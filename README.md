# Age-and-Gender-Prediction-with-Emotion-Detection

The primary goal of this project is to create an all-encompassing system for the real-time detection and analysis of facial features.
This system integrates three models: facial expression recognition, age estimation, and gender classification. The project seeks to offer valuable insights for various applications, including customer satisfaction, human-computer interaction, security systems, healthcare, and entertainment.
